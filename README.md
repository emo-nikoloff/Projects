# Personal Programming Projects

Welcome to my personal programming projects repository! This repository contains various projects that I have created to practice and improve my skills in different programming languages.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders by programming language:

- `C#/` - Projects written in C#
- `Python/` - Projects written in Python

Each folder contains individual projects with their own code files, and in some cases, additional resources or documentation.

## Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to:

- Experiment with new programming concepts and techniques
- Keep track of my personal coding projects
- Share my work with others for learning or collaboration
